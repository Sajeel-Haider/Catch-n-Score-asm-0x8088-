# Catch-n-Score

The Catch and Score project is a game developed in assembly language (0x8088) where the player's objective is to hit objects while avoiding TNT. The game features a function that generates random numbers, determining the location of the objects to be rendered on the screen.

The gameplay involves controlling a character or an avatar using keyboard inputs to move horizontally and catch the falling objects. The player must carefully time their movements to catch as many objects as possible while avoiding TNT, which can cause the game to end.

The game provides visual feedback as the objects and TNT are rendered on the screen, creating an engaging and interactive experience for the player. The random number generation ensures that each playthrough offers a unique and challenging gameplay session.

Players can accumulate points by successfully catching objects, and the score is displayed on the screen, providing a sense of achievement and competitiveness. The game may feature a scoring system that rewards players with additional points or bonuses for consecutive successful catches or other milestones.

Throughout the game, the player's reflexes, hand-eye coordination, and strategic decision-making skills are put to the test. The challenge lies in maintaining accuracy and speed while avoiding TNT, which adds an element of risk and excitement to the gameplay.

The Catch and Score project demonstrates the application of assembly language programming techniques, including random number generation, rendering objects on the screen, and handling user input. It showcases the combination of game mechanics, visuals, and user interaction to create an enjoyable and immersive gaming experience.
